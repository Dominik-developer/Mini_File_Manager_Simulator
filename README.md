# Mini File Manager Simulator

## Project Description

Mini File Manager Simulator is a simple, modular file system simulator written in C. It allows you to perform basic file and directory operations in a terminal environment, without using the actual file system.

### Main Features

- Create, delete, and browse files and directories
- Manage directory structure
- In-memory file operations
- Text-based CLI interface

### Project Structure

- `src/` – source code
- `include/` – header files
- `data/` – sample data or files used by the program
- `run` – launch script

### Requirements

- C compiler (e.g. gcc)
- Linux/macOS/Windows operating system

### How to Run

Simply execute:

```sh
./run
```

The `run` script will automatically compile the project and, if you confirm by typing `y` or `Y`, launch the program. This makes setup and execution easier for new users.

### Code Comments

The code contains comments to help you understand the logic and structure. These comments are intended for educational purposes and to make the code easier to follow, especially for those learning about memory management and data structures in C.
